### What is ElectionsPOO
The Election Management App is a Java application developed using the NetBeans IDE that provides a user-friendly interface for creating, managing, and simulating elections. This application is designed to streamline the election process, allowing users to effortlessly generate elections, manage candidate lists, and simulate random voters for testing purposes.

### Features
- User-Friendly Interface: The app boasts an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that facilitates easy navigation and interaction with various election management functionalities.

- Election Generation and Management: Users can create new elections with customizable parameters such as election type, date, and candidates. The app provides tools for managing candidate lists, including adding, editing, and removing candidates.

- Random Voter Generation: To assist with testing and simulation, the app allows the generation of random voters with randomized preferences. This feature aids in assessing the functionality and fairness of the election system. All the random voters have a profile picture obtained from the API: fakeface.rest

- Data Persistence: All election-related data, including election details, candidate lists, and voter information, are stored in files. This data is saved in a structured format that enables easy retrieval and reopening of past elections for analysis.

- Open and Resume Past Elections: Users can open and resume any previously created elections. This feature is particularly useful for reviewing election results, analyzing voter patterns, and making improvements to the election process.
